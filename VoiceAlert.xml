Panic Test Button (Andy's Office) Life is short, and if we enjoy every moment of every day, then we will be happy no matter what happens or what changes along the way. With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts. Enjoy the journey and try to get better every day. And don't lose the passion and the love for what you do.
